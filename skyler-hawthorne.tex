My interest in Computer Science began in my first semester of college, when I took an introductory course on programming in \CPP. Since that course, every semester thereafter left me more and more captivated by the beauty of computing. Computer algorithms are truly captivating. Every problem breaks down into pieces that seem trivial on their own, but come together to form an awe-inspiring, cohesive whole which manages to keep itself stable. Simple pieces come together to compose elaborate, complex, mechanical structures which form the foundation of our modern society.

Since my introductory course, my interests have branched into many other specialized topics. Particular topics which interest me (but which I do not claim to be an expert in) are: cryptography, discrete optimization, parallelization, and systems programming.

Thus far, I have completed one six-month internship at a San Francisco-based startup called CloudPassage, and am currently enjoying my second internship at OpenDNS.
